# getAmazonPartStatus
A simple Powershell script to determine if a given amazon product is currently a good buy

## Purpose
During times of COVID-19 with production and manufacturing facilities not operating at peak capacity, prices of good such as pc componenets and other technology may inherantly become more expensive. getAmazonPartStatus.ps1 was created to help determine if now is a good time to buy.

## How it works
Using GET requests, we retrieve the product name, current price, and availability of the product directly from that amazon uri provided. Next we retrieve the lowest price recorded for the product from camelcamelcamel.

Create txt file with following format for use with -FilePath argument (See Example: partList.txt):
```
<tag with no spaces>|<Amazon Uri>
```

## Features
* Gets tag and Amazon Uri's from txt file
* If amazon believes we are a robot, script will download the captcha image to the desktop of the user running the script and open it with your default image viewer. After passing the captcha test, the image is deleted.
* Gets product information directly from the amazon uri provided. Supports Amazon direct product Uri's and cart Uri's.
* Gets lowest price information from camelcamelcamel.com (Must have minimum timeout of 20 sec between requests, else they get refused)
* Returns unformatted PowerShell object
